# MEA Tools

Tools for viewing, analyzing, and processing multi-electrode array data.

The core of the package is a python module, pymea, which has many components for interacting with data acquired by MultiChannel Systems software. Data files must be converted to HDF5 files using [MultiChannel Systems Data Manager]( http://www.multichannelsystems.com/software/multi-channel-datamanager) before they can be viewed or analyzed with pymea. 

This package also contains useful Mathematica functions for interacting with analog data and spike data.
